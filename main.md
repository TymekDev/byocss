title: "Main (byocss)"
---

Main is by far the simplest part of [byocss](https://sr.ht/~tymek/byocss).
[By default][0], if a page has content, then it is contained in a single `<main>` tag.
Otherwise, main block remains empty.
The block can be overridden as described in [customization section](index.md#customization).
